Dems did nothing for you but get your vote! #NeverForget @foxandfriends,' the president added.

The framework document was only developed by Republicans, but Trump has been reaching out to Democrats in an effort to get their support on tax reform as well.  'It's time for both parties to come together and do what is right for the American people and the nation that we all love.'",

Prior to the TCJA, the taxpayer who was eligible to claim the child\"s dependent exemption was also the one eligible to claim the CTC.
